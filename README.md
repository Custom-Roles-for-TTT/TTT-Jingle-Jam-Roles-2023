# _Custom Roles for TTT_ Roles Pack for Jingle Jam 2023
A pack of [Custom Roles for TTT](https://github.com/Custom-Roles-for-TTT/TTT-Custom-Roles) roles created based on the generous donations of our community members in support of [Jingle Jam 2023](https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/).

# Roles



## Physician
_Suggested By_: Logan\
The Physician is a Detective role who spawns with a Health Tracker. The Physician can use their custom weapon to place trackers on terrorists to monitor their health from the scoreboard.
An upgrade exclusive to them is available in their shop which upgrades the range and quality of tracking.
